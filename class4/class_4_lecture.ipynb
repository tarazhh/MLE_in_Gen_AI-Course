    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    * chunk_size: Defines the maximum number of characters in each chunk.\n",
    "    * chunk_overlap: Specifies the number of characters that should overlap between consecutive chunks. This overlap ensures context is preserved across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How It Works\n",
    "The splitter operates by attempting to divide the text using a hierarchy of separators, aiming to preserve the semantic integrity of the content. The default separator hierarchy is:\n",

    "    1. Paragraph breaks (\\n\\n)\n",

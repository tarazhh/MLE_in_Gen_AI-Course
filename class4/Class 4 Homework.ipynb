    "# Week 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with arXiv Papers\n",
    "This week marks a major shift in your AI agent's capabilities: you’ll build the foundation for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored to scientific research. Rather than relying on an LLM’s memory alone, RAG architectures allow your agent to search a structured knowledge base and generate grounded, document-aware answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a RAG pipeline using recent arXiv cs.CL papers, converting them into searchable chunks, embedding them, and indexing them with FAISS. You’ll then implement a simple query interface that takes a user question, retrieves the top relevant chunks, and displays them for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week marks the beginning of building your agent’s private research knowledge base—a semantic index that you’ll evolve into a full-featured hybrid database in Week 5."

    "## Project Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will guide you through building a RAG pipeline on arXiv cs.CL papers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:** Obtain 50 arXiv cs.CL PDFs (you can scrape via the arXiv API or use a provided sample set).\n",
    "2. **Text Extraction:** Extract raw text from each PDF (for example, using PyMuPDF's `get_text()` on each page). Clean and concatenate the page text into full-document strings.\n",
    "3. **Text Chunking:** Split each paper into chunks (≤ 512 tokens each). You might split at section boundaries or use a sliding-window approach (e.g., 500-token windows with overlap). Chunking into smaller, meaningful segments (around 250–512 tokens) often yields better retrieval precision.\n",
    "4. **Embedding Generation:** Compute dense vector embeddings for each chunk. For instance, using the `sentence-transformers` library:"

    "   (Alternatively, you can use a Hugging Face Transformer model and apply pooling manually to get chunk embeddings.)\n",
    "5. **Indexing with FAISS:** Build a FAISS index of the chunk embeddings. For example, use a simple index like `IndexFlatL2` with the same dimensionality as your embeddings. Add all chunk vectors to the index (e.g., `index.add(np.array(embeddings))`).\n",
    "6. **Notebook Demo:** Create a notebook where a user query is embedded and passed to the index (`index.search(query_embedding, k)`) to retrieve the top-3 matching chunks. Display the original chunk text for these results.\n",
    "7. **FastAPI Service:** Build a simple FastAPI app. Define an endpoint (e.g. `@app.get(\"/search\")`) that accepts a query parameter `q`. In the handler, embed `q`, perform the FAISS search, and return the top passages as JSON. (For example, a FastAPI endpoint can accept a question and return relevant documents.)\n"

    "\n",
    "* Experiment with different chunk sizes and overlaps. Smaller chunks (∼250 tokens) often give more precise retrieval, while larger chunks include more context.\n",

    "* Implement a simple reranking step: for example, after retrieving candidates with FAISS, re-score them with a cross-encoder model for finer ranking.\n",
    "* Use metadata: consider filtering or weighting chunks by paper metadata (e.g. year, authors, keywords) to improve relevance if needed.\n"
